COMPONENT WORKFLOW


1. Create the component with your React.createClass.
    A. Require React
    B. Add module.exports
    c. create the class, Double bracket, then render, then return
    d. if the component has no children, you can use function(props) instead of creating a class.
2. Add an alias to webpack.config with the path
3. Require it in your app.jsx
4. If it's a default component, place it in indexRoute
5. If it's not a default component, place it in a child route under Main
    A. Decide a name for the route that matches the component name
    B. Make sure your main includes this.props.children
    C. Make sure you link to it somewhere with the Link tag
        1. Link tags allow you to set event listeners to see if that's the page you're on, and set an active style
        2. You can check if a link is active by saying activeClassName = "active"
        3. You can specify inline CSS in React with activeStyle ={{fontWeight: "bold"}}
        4. You must use camelCase in react, no dashes allowed unless they're lodashes.
    D. In Main.jsx, include the following:     var {Link, IndexLink} = require("react-router")
        1. Link is used for non-default links
        2. IndexLink is used for links that come up as the default route
        3. Make sure all routes and index routes are within a route with path = "/", unless you want a reload in between.
6. If you intend to pass in any props:
    A. start by creating a getDefaultProps method, which is a function() that returns a {} containing key-value-pairs.
    B. create a propTypes:{} object, setting the default types of the getDefaultProps items to React.PropTypes.(type of var)
        ***The object keeps bugging out, so I've been using propTypes: function(){return {key: value}} instead.
    C. To destructure any props you're going to use in the render, put var {(propertyName)} = this.props
    D. To call a method on any props, make sure to say this.(METHOD)(What to run the method on).
